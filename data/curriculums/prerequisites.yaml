# for each class encode its DIRECT prerequisites
# This can be done by groups like the curriculum, but it is assumed that all requirements must be satisfied
# If you want to have a prerequisite be A or B encode this as a group AORB, and have this group be the sole prerequisite
# courses with no prerequisites need not be included
